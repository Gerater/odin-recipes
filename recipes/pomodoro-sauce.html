        <ol>
        <li>First of all, we are gonna cut the carrots, the little they are, the better. Same thing with the onions.</li>
        <li>Put the vegetables in a pot with a cup of water. Just to saut√© them. Do this, stirring them, for fifteen minutes. </li>
        <li>When they are a bit golden, put the entire can of tomato on the pot, with 4 liters of water.</li>
        <li>Add the condiments, the oregano, provencal and the ground chili. After that, salt and sugar to taste. Keep stirring</li>
        <li>When the carrots are soft (prick the carrot with a knife), with a big mixer, mix the sauce until creamy.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the large amount of sauce!</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>This sauce is pretty basic, so you can add more vegetables at the beggining, or more seasonings with the oregano!</p>
